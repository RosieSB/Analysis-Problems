# How to use this booklet

Maths is best learned by doing many problems. 

This problem booklet serves 3 purposes: 

(PoW)=
1. **Problems of the Week.** <br>
Each week, I will circulate a selection of problems from this booklet that relate most closely to the material covered in lectures that week. I recommend working on these steadily throughout the semester, and keeping a record of any you would like [help](https://rosiesb.github.io/Analysis-Notes/0Intro.html#where-to-get-help) with.<br>

2. **Tutorials.** <br>
The problem set for each tutorial will come from this booklet.<br>

3. **Homework.** <br>
Written homework will be a selection of problems from the problem booklet. <br>
