# MAS2004/9 Analysis Problem Booklet

Maths is best learned by doing many problems. 

This problem booklet serves 3 purposes: 

1. **Problems of the Week.** Each week, I will circulate a selection of problems from this booklet that relate most closely to the material covered in lectures that week. I recommend working on these steadily throughout the semester, and keeping a record of any you would like help with (e.g. in tutorials or [office hours](https://calendar.app.google/1LFwxG3HSMFM8pC17)).

2. **Tutorials.** The problem set for each tutorial will come from this booklet.

3. **Homework**. Written homework will be a selection of problems from the problem booklet. 

See Blackboard[^links] for more information.
