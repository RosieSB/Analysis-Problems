# MAS2004/9 Analysis Problem Booklet

Maths is best learned by doing many problems. This problem booklet accompanies the modules MAS2009 Analysis and Semester 2 of MAS2004 Analysis and Algebra. 

It serves 3 purposes:

1. Problems of the Week. <br> 
To help with your own independent practice, each week, I will circulate a selection of problems from this booklet that relate most closely to the material covered in lectures that week. I recommend working on these steadily throughout the semester, and keeping a record of any you would like help with (e.g. in tutorials or [office hours](https://calendar.app.google/1LFwxG3HSMFM8pC17)).

2. Tutorials. <br>
The problem set for each tutorial will come from this booklet.

3. Homework. <br>
Written homework will be a selection of problems from the problem booklet. 

See Blackboard[^links] for more information.
